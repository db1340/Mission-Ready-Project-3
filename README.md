# Mission-Ready-Project-3

# Progressing the Project
In this Mission, you will take the API you created, and build a DevOps pipeline to deploy it automatically. 
<br>

Task 4. Provide feedback to UX Designers on feasibility
<br>

UX Designers will ask you to provide some feedback about how feasible their designs are.  Each designer is required to get feedback from at least two developers. Your task is to understand the prototype functionalities along with the high-fidelity design, and let the UX designer know from a Developer's perspective, whether there are things that they can tweak to make coding significantly easier.  It is ok to let them know they do not need to make changes if nothing can be tweaked to make coding easier.
<br>

Task 5. Build a DevOps pipeline for your API 
<br>

Build a pipeline that deploys your API from Mission 1 or 2 to a cloud automatically. You need to build the pipeline using Github Actions so that as soon as you “git push” a new version of the code to your Github repository, the new code will automatically get deployed to Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud, and your new version of API is available on the cloud. Also automate the running of unit tests as part of the pipeline.

Task 7. Present at Show and Tell 
<br>

At the Show and Tell next week, your team will jointly present the tasks it has completed.  This presentation should be designed to take around 5 minutes for each team member – so, if you are in a 4-people team you have up 20 minutes in total.  The time limit will be strictly enforced.  You can use PowerPoint slides, Sway or Prezi to help with your presentation.  You are encouraged to demonstrate the live DevOps pipeline. 
<br>

Task 8. Submit your work 
<br>

By the end of Thursday, upload all of your work (screenshots, presentation slides, documents or other files) using the mission submission form.
